			As soon as you drive in to Highland Crossing you will be captivated by the beauty of Pearland. Highland Crossing is settled among the greenbelt area, with access to numerous parks and trails.  
<br><br>
Our community enjoys family fun in the outdoors, from picnics in the covered pavilion to playing at the park. With a prime Pearland ISD location, we have easy access to the Sam Houston Tollway and can reach downtown Houston in 25 minutes. We live in a relaxing setting that's still close to the action. Home. Sweet. Home. Welcome to our community!
